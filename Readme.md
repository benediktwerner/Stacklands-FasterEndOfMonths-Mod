# Stacklands FasterEndOfMonths Mod

Makes eating food instant and removes the "start month" button.

There also is a configuration option to reduce or disable saving at the end of the month which makes the cutscene almost instant.

## Development

- Build using `dotnet build`
- For release builds, add `-c Release`
- If you're using VSCode, the `.vscode/tasks.json` file allows building via `Run Build`/`Ctrl+Shift+B`
